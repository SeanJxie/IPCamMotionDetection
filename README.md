# IPCamMotionDetection
Detect motion and capture it with an IP Camera.

# Usage
- With Python and `pip` installed, `pip install opencv-python` and run `IPCam.py` with any IDE.
- Install [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en_CA), run the app, and input the IPv4 string given to you by the app.
- Specify detection sensitivity inputs, file path, and you're done.

# Executable
- With Pyinstaller, the compiled .exe comes to 40MB alone and 28MB with UPX compression which still isn't the smallest program. I'm trying to the reduce the size even more so that it may be installed at a practical size. If you really want to download the program executable: [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3dohe31xzaq7i3h/IPCam.exe?dl=0).

# Development
- Better speed 
- Better detection
